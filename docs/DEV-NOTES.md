# Development notes

The idea is to implement the [IBM Quantum backend code challenge](https://github.com/IBMQuantum/backend-code-challenge).

Doing this coding practice the goals are:
* Using Hexagonal Architecture new insights.
* Using TDD or ATDD.
* Decomposing "stories" into thin vertical slices.

## Requirements

The instructions don't define user stories, so we will just write down the requirements given.

* Query Pokemons by type.
* Query favorite Pokemons.
* Query Pokemons paginated.
* Get a Pokemon by its ID.
* Get a Pokemon by its name.
* Get the types of Pokemons as a list.
* Mark (or unmark) a Pokemon as favorite.

## Step by step development

My first step will be to check the requirements, removing duplicated functionality and organizing (sorting) them to make the development process simpler.

* Get a Pokemon by its ID.
* Get a Pokemon by its name.
* Query Pokemons paginated.
* Query Pokemons by type.
* Mark (or unmark) a Pokemon as favorite.
* Query favorite Pokemons.
* Get the types of Pokemons as a list.
